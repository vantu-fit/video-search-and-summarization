# NemoClaw Skill Eval Runner

This directory contains the GitHub CI integration for opt-in NemoClaw/OpenClaw skill evaluation.

- `notebook_cells.json` selects setup-only cells from `deploy/docker/scripts/deploy_nemoclaw_vss.ipynb` by stable cell id.
- `notebook_setup_adapter.py` builds and executes the temporary setup notebook, then writes `/tmp/skill-eval/nemoclaw/nemoclaw.env` on the Brev worker.
- `readiness.py` checks host tools, sandbox state, and VSS Orchestrator MCP health before Harbor runs the scenario.
- `headless_runner.py` is called from the Harbor trial. It posts the real task prompt to the OpenClaw hooks endpoint so the scenario runs through NemoClaw/OpenClaw.

Harbor remains the CI entrypoint and result owner. The default runner is unchanged unless a spec declares `runner: "nemoclaw"` / `requires_nemoclaw: true`, or a manual workflow dispatch selects `runner=nemoclaw`.

When manual dispatch uses `runner=nemoclaw`, `skills=vss-deploy-profile` keeps the lightweight base-profile smoke behavior. `skills=*` discovers adapter-backed `skills/*/evals/*.json` specs, wraps their generated Harbor tasks as NemoClaw/OpenClaw launcher tasks, and reports unsupported eval specs as blocked coverage gaps.

"""Skills eval agent — single-shot CI-driven runner.

Spawns one `claude-agent-sdk` agent with `.github/skill-eval/AGENTS.md`
as its system prompt and lets it drive an eval end-to-end:
adapter/dataset → Brev box selection → run_leg.py → results comment. Two modes:

  - Single-spec (push): the `plan` job in skills-eval.yml resolves the PR
    diff into a matrix of one leg per (spec, platform); each leg invokes
    this script with EVAL_* set and evaluates exactly that one trial.
  - Manual full-sweep (workflow_dispatch): no diff; enumerate every spec
    on the picked skill(s) and write tables to $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY.

The agent gets Bash/Read/Edit/Write/Glob/Grep, and is explicitly told (in
AGENTS.md) it must NOT modify anything under `skills/`. Background/task
tools are disabled (see ClaudeAgentOptions below) so it drives harbor
synchronously.

Env (set by the workflow step):
    PR_NUMBER             PR being evaluated, e.g. "100" (blank on workflow_dispatch)
    PR_BASE               Base branch, e.g. "develop" (blank on workflow_dispatch)
    PR_HEAD_SHA           Mirror or main-branch head SHA (full)
    PR_REPO               "owner/repo"
    GITHUB_RUN_ID         CI run id (lock + results dir scoping)
    GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY   Markdown file appended to the Actions run summary;
                          manual-sweep writes per-spec tables here.
    EVAL_KIND             Single-spec mode: "eval" or "missing_adapter".
    EVAL_SKILL            Single-spec mode: the skill dir name.
    EVAL_SPEC_PATH        Single-spec mode: skills/<skill>/evals/<spec>.json.
    EVAL_SPEC_STEM        Single-spec mode: the spec filename without .json.
    EVAL_PLATFORM         Single-spec mode: the one platform this leg runs.
    MANUAL_SKILLS_FILTER  Skill name from the dispatch input, or "*" for all —
                          consumed by plan_matrix.py to build the manual-sweep
                          matrix; manual legs run as single-spec with an empty
                          PR_NUMBER (results go to the job summary).
    ANTHROPIC_*           Agent SDK credentials (sourced from coordinator .env)
    GH_TOKEN              PR comment posting (push mode only)
    NGC_CLI_API_KEY       Local NIM pulls in trials
    LLM_REMOTE_URL        Optional; enables remote-* deploy modes
    VLM_REMOTE_URL        Optional; enables remote-* deploy modes
    BREV_ENV_ID           Set by Brev on the coordinator host; part of secure-link URLs

Exit codes:
    0 - agent completed (eval may still report failures in PR comment)
    1 - setup error (missing env, AGENTS.md not found, sdk install failed)
    2 - agent crashed
    3 - agent hit max_turns without finishing

    surfaces it as pollable task output. That silently defeats AGENTS.md's

    include lock contention plus one or more ordered Harbor subprocesses, so
    the foreground cap must cover the bounded wrapper call, not just one
    default 10-minute Bash attempt. Past the cap the foreground call is
    backgrounded and the agent

    run_in_background *after* the timeout, not in the call input the hook

# No process-side cleanup here by design — each trial deploys whatever
# VSS profile it needs as part of its own first agent turn (the harness
# no longer pre-deploys or maintains an active-deploy marker). A
# previous-run leftover container on the box is the next trial's deploy-
# step problem, not the harness's, and tools like
# `docker compose down` invoked by the agent reconcile cleanly. That
# makes every exit path equivalent from the next run's perspective —
# happy path, max-turns, cancel-in-progress SIGTERM, agent crash,
# SIGKILL, host reboot — so we don't need atexit / signal handlers / a
# touched-boxes ledger to chase the cases where end-of-run cleanup
# might be skipped.

"""Harbor environment provider for Brev GPU instances.

Connects to a pre-existing operator-managed `vss-eval-*` pool member
resolved via the `BREV_INSTANCE` env var (or `brev_instance` in
task.toml [metadata]). Validates that the resolved instance is
reachable and that its GPU meets the task's requirements; raises if
no instance is resolved. The harness does NOT auto-provision — see
AGENTS.md § 5a for the fleet-selection algorithm the skill-eval
agent uses to pick a pool member.

Task.toml [metadata] fields consumed:
    gpu_type              — e.g. "L40S", "H100", "RTX PRO 6000"
    gpu_count             — 1 or 2
    min_vram_gb_per_gpu   — e.g. 48, 80
    min_root_disk_gb      — root-disk floor enforced post-resolve
    min_gpu_driver_version — driver floor enforced post-resolve
    brev_instance         — (optional) explicit instance name override

        """Wipe the warm-pool box's docker runtime before the trial.

        Removes **all** containers (running + stopped), **all** volumes
        (named + anonymous), and **all** user-defined networks, while
        **preserving images** — re-pulling the multi-GB VSS/NIM image set on
        every trial would dominate wall-clock.

        Why blanket, not VSS-project-scoped: trials reach a deploy through
        heterogeneous paths — direct `docker compose --profile …`, the
        `/vss-deploy-profile` runbook, an MCP-orchestrator base deploy — under
        different compose project names. A project- or label-scoped
        `compose down` from the incoming trial therefore cannot reach a
        *predecessor's* stack, so a leftover container port-conflicts the new
        deploy (observed: a profile_in_1 trial where `phoenix` was stuck
        `Created` and several init containers were missing because a prior
        base-profile deploy's containers still held the ports). Removing
        everything is the only reset that doesn't depend on knowing what the
        last trial deployed. Safe because `vss-eval-*` boxes are a dedicated,
        flock-serialised eval pool — nothing else runs on them.

        NOTE: wiping all volumes also drops the model-weight caches
        (`rtvi-hf-cache`, `rtvi-ngc-model-cache`), so the next deploy pays the
        full cold model-weight download (~20 min vs ~55 s warm). The caller
        gates this to a spec's first trial only (single-step, or step-1 of a
        multi-step spec — later steps reuse step-1's deployment), so under the
        canonical `-n 1 --max-retries 0` invocation (one trial per spec) the
        cost is paid once per spec, not once per step. An `-n>1` rollout, a
        harbor retry, or a repeated manual run on the same warm box each
        re-wipes the caches and re-pays the cold start. The per-trial harbor
        timeout already budgets for a cold deploy.

        Runs as the normal (docker-group) user — the same identity the
        trial's deploy uses; no sudo. `network prune` leaves the built-in
        bridge/host/none networks, which is correct. Fails loud (`set -u`,
        explicit `exit 1`) if the daemon is unreachable or dies mid-reset, or
        if any container, volume, or user-defined network survives, so a
        half-reset box surfaces as a trial error rather than silent cross-trial
        contamination.

        Why this is in the env provider (not the deploy adapter): the
        vss-deploy-profile adapter's solve.sh syncs the repo on the *gold-solution*
        path, but the trial's claude-code agent invokes `/vss-deploy-profile`
        directly against whatever's on disk. Without this sync, the
        forwarded `PR_HEAD_SHA` env var has no effect on the actual
        compose/skill files the agent reads.

        Handles three pre-states:

        - **Empty / missing dir** — fresh clone.
        - **Stale non-git checkout** (tarball-style, no `.git` dir) —
          this is the load-bearing fix: prior versions of the dir
          shipped from before the repo was renamed and the layout
          changed (`deployments/` not `deploy/docker/`). Nuke and
          re-clone; never silently fall through to `git fetch` on
          a non-git dir.
        - **Existing git checkout** — `git remote set-url` (handles
          cross-fork PRs) + `git fetch <PR_HEAD_SHA>` + hard reset.

        Preserves `data/` (NGC sample bundle) and `.env` (active trial
        overrides) on `git clean`. Fails loud — `set -euo pipefail` so

Use the `vios-dev-sanity` agent (via the Agent tool) to execute sanity test cases from `vios_dev_sanity.xlsx` against a running VIOS web UI instance using Playwright.

The agent reads the test plan **dynamically from the xlsx at runtime** — it does not have a hardcoded test matrix. When tests are added or changed in the xlsx, they are picked up automatically.

## Usage

```
/vios-dev-sanity                                               # parse xlsx, show test plan, await instruction
/vios-dev-sanity run all                                       # auto-detect deployment, execute all tests
/vios-dev-sanity run all --url http://<HOST>:30888/vst   # run against a specific deployment
/vios-dev-sanity run all --filter WebRTC                       # run only WebRTC category tests
/vios-dev-sanity run all --filter "Sensor Management"          # run only Sensor Management tests
/vios-dev-sanity run all --xlsx /path/to/custom.xlsx           # use a different xlsx file
/vios-dev-sanity run all --nvstreamer-url http://ip:31000      # specify NvStreamer URL explicitly
/vios-dev-sanity run all --skip-xls-update                     # dry run — do not write results back to xlsx
```

### `--url` flag

Explicitly target a specific VIOS deployment. The agent normalizes it automatically (strips hash fragment and trailing slash):
```
--url http://<HOST>:30888/vst/#/dashboard   # accepted
--url http://<HOST>:30888/vst               # accepted
```

**If omitted**: the agent auto-detects a running local deployment by probing `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and all local IPv4 addresses on port 30888. If nothing is found, it starts a deployment automatically using the `vios-deployment` skill.

### `--filter` flag

Substring match against sheet name or category name (case-insensitive). Use to run a subset of tests without editing the xlsx:
```
--filter WebRTC               # only WebRTC category
--filter "Sensor Management"  # only Sensor Management category
--filter Sheet2               # only tests from Sheet2
```

### `--xlsx` flag

Path to the xlsx test plan. Default: agent searches for `vios_dev_sanity.xlsx` in the working directory and parent directories.

### `--nvstreamer-url` flag

NvStreamer base URL. If omitted, the agent auto-detects a **local** NvStreamer (running container's published port, or a probe of `http://localhost:31000`). The "add RTSP" / H265 tests use this local NvStreamer (`http://localhost:31000/...`) as their source.

### Environment preflight

Environment-specific values (IPs, hosts, ports, image tags) are not committed to the repo. The agent resolves them from the live environment at startup — running containers, `compose.env`, and the sensor API. Anything that cannot be auto-detected is requested **once, at the start**, before any test runs. Most commonly: if **no local NvStreamer is detected**, the agent prompts for a **NvStreamer IP** and uses `http://<that-ip>:31000` for the run. The agent also checks the NvStreamer stream count and, if fewer than two streams are present, asks you to add more before running (Video Wall and multi-sensor tests need at least two).

### `--update-xls` flag

Accepted for backward compatibility but is now a no-op — results and remarks are **always written back to the xlsx** after execution. Use `--skip-xls-update` to suppress the write (dry-run or read-only environment).

## What the agent does

1. Prints `tail -f /tmp/vios-sanity-progress.log` immediately — open this in a second terminal for live progress
2. Parses the xlsx to build the test list (all sheets, all non-empty rows)
3. Prints a test plan summary (count per sheet, auto-skipped tests)
4. Verifies VIOS service health via `browser_navigate` to dashboard
5. Executes each test case in order, interpreting the "Steps to Verify" column
6. Captures a start timestamp before each test and end timestamp after
7. After each test: prints `[N/TOTAL] Category / Feature — PASS` to the main conversation
8. On FAIL: pulls `docker logs` from `stream-processor-ms` and `sensor-ms` for the test time window, analyzes for errors, and prints a root cause summary to the user immediately
9. Writes real-time progress to `/tmp/vios-sanity-progress.log` throughout
10. Always writes results and remarks back to the xlsx after all tests complete (use `--skip-xls-update` to suppress)
11. Emits a final summary table (PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED/SKIPPED counts + failed test list with root causes)

## Live progress

The agent always creates `/tmp/vios-sanity-progress.log`. Tail it for real-time status without waiting for the run to complete:

```bash
tail -f /tmp/vios-sanity-progress.log
```

Output looks like:
```
